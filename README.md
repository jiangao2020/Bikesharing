## Story Summaries
### 1. Central Question
What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
### 2. Population Comparison
In 2018 the estimated New York City population is 8,398,748, which is much largaer than Des Monies population 215,932
Analysis: The large number of population means more opportunities in the usage of bike-sharing program. 
### 3. Age Distribution Comparison
Des Moines and New York City have similar age disributions, which show a relatively large population of 20-34 years old. 
Analysis: Compare the age distribution to CitiBike data, we can observe the large population in 20-34 years old groups matches the high usage of CitiBike in NYC
### 4. Gender Breakdown
CitiBike data shows that male are more likely to use CitiBike thank Female. However, in 2018, both Des Moines and New York City populations show that female population is slightly larger than male population . Therefore, the gender ratio of the city is not significantly influencing the CitiBike usage. 
### 5. Provety Level and Race Composition
These two cities have similar provety rate in 2018. Des Moines has larger number of white alone popultion, but the race compositions are similar between the two cities. So, we expect the CitiBike usage will be similar. 
### 6. User Types
The CitiBike data shows that around 19% of the uesers are non-subscribers, and they can be tourists. In 2018, New York City welcomed 65.1 million visitor, and 13.7 million people visited Des Monies. Even though Des Moines has smaller number of visitors comparing to NYC, we can see it is still a big ratio to its city population. Also, the population growth rate in Des Monies is 4.9% (from April 2010 to July 2019), which means there are more potential users of bike-sharing program. 
### 7.Summary
After conduct research and compare with the CitiBike data, we can conclude that Des Monies shares similar demographics in  age, gender, race, provety rate, and user type.
